# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Overview
This project focuses on asynchronous generators, comprehensions, and understanding how to type-annotate them in Python. You will work with Python's `async` and `await` syntax to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently, leveraging asynchronous comprehensions to gather results from asynchronous generators.

## Concepts
- Asynchronous generators and comprehensions
- Concurrent execution using `asyncio`
- Type annotations for async functions and generators

## Tasks

| Task # | Filename | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | [0-async_generator.py](./0-async_generator.py) | Write a coroutine `async_generator` that loops 10 times, each time asynchronously waiting 1 second, then yielding a random number between 0 and 10. |
| 1 | [1-async_comprehension.py](./1-async_comprehension.py) | Write a coroutine `async_comprehension` that collects 10 random numbers using an async comprehension over `async_generator` and returns the collected numbers. |
| 2 | [2-measure_runtime.py](./2-measure_runtime.py) | Write a coroutine `measure_runtime` that executes `async_comprehension` four times in parallel using `asyncio.gather`. Measure the total runtime and return it. |

## File Descriptions

### [0-async_generator.py](./0-async_generator.py)
This file contains the implementation of `async_generator`, a coroutine that asynchronously generates and yields random numbers between 0 and 10 over 10 iterations, with a 1-second delay between each yield.

### [1-async_comprehension.py](./1-async_comprehension.py)
In this file, the `async_comprehension` coroutine is defined. It collects the 10 random numbers generated by `async_generator` using an asynchronous comprehension and returns the list of these numbers.

### [2-measure_runtime.py](./2-measure_runtime.py)
This file implements `measure_runtime`, which runs `async_comprehension` four times in parallel using `asyncio.gather`. It measures the total time taken for the execution and returns it.

## Setup Environment
